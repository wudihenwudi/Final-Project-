Final-Project-
==============
For this final project I gonna do it in a group with other 2 or 3 people. 
From now, my teamate had an idea that we plan to do, which is, 

Problem: Range of rational reconstruction
Given positive integer n > 2 , how many elements in the set Z/nZ
can be written as m/d, with m,|d| <= sqrt(n/2)?

Goal: Give an asymptotic formula as n -> infty
